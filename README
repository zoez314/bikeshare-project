Bike Share Data Analysis
Project Overview
This project aims to analyze and explore bike share usage data from three major U.S. cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, D.C. The data provides insights into user travel patterns, including common travel times, popular stations, trip durations, and user demographics. The goal is to help stakeholders better understand the behavior and trends of bike share users, ultimately improving services and resource allocation.

Data Overview
The dataset consists of data collected over the first six months of 2017. The data files contain the following columns:
	•	Start Time: The start timestamp for the bike trip (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57).
	•	End Time: The end timestamp for the bike trip (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53).
	•	Trip Duration: Duration of the trip in seconds (e.g., 776).
	•	Start Station: The name of the station where the bike was picked up (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave).
	•	End Station: The name of the station where the bike was returned (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave).
	•	User Type: The type of user (Subscriber or Customer).
	•	Gender (for Chicago and New York City): The gender of the user (Male, Female).
	•	Birth Year (for Chicago and New York City): The birth year of the user.
Functionality
The program provides the following features:
1. City, Month, and Day Filters
Users can select a city, a month, and a day of the week to filter the data based on their preferences.
2. Time Statistics
Displays statistics on the most frequent times of travel, such as:
	•	The most common month
	•	The most common day of the week
	•	The most common start hour
3. Station Statistics
Displays statistics on the most popular stations and trips, such as:
	•	The most commonly used start station
	•	The most commonly used end station
	•	The most frequent combination of start and end stations
4. Trip Duration Statistics
Displays statistics on the total and average trip duration, such as:
	•	Total travel time
	•	Average travel time
5. User Statistics
Displays statistics on bikeshare users, such as:
	•	Counts of user types (Subscribers and Customers)
	•	Counts of genders (for Chicago and New York City)
	•	Earliest, most recent, and most common birth years (for Chicago and New York City)
6. Restart Option
After displaying the results for a selected city, month, and day, the program prompts the user to restart the process with different parameters if desired.
Requirements
To run this project, you will need:
	•	Python 3.x or later
	•	pandas: Data analysis library used for data manipulation.
	•	numpy: Library for numerical operations.
	•	time: Library for measuring execution time.
You can install the required libraries by running:

pip install pandas numpy
How to Run the Project
	1	Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.
	2	Make sure you have the required CSV data files for the cities (chicago.csv, new_york_city.csv, washington.csv) in the same directory as the script.
	3	Run the Python script:

python bikeshare_2.py
	4	Follow the prompts in the terminal to explore the bike share data:
	◦	Select a city (chicago, new york city, washington)
	◦	Select a month (january, february, march, ..., june, or 'all')
	◦	Select a day of the week (monday, tuesday, ..., sunday, or 'all')
	5	The program will output the statistics based on your selections and will ask if you'd like to restart the process.
Example Output
The program will display results similar to the following:
Which city would you like to explore? (chicago, new york city, washington): chicago
Which month would you like to explore? (january, february, march, april, may, june, or 'all'): may
Which day of the week would you like to explore? (monday, tuesday, ..., sunday, or 'all'): monday
